#Welcome
  These are the important information for Minecraftly Cloud Platform.  Read them carefully,
as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to install the
software, and what to do if something goes wrong. 

#What is Minecraftly?
  Minecraftly (Minecraftly Cloud Platform) is a free and open source (FOSS) alternative of the official Mojang's Minecraft Realms, designed and written from scratch by Viet Nguyen and Keir Nellyer, respectively, with assistance from some friendly developers and helpers from the internet. It aims towards creating an easy to run a distributed network, on any server, using traditional server system.

  It has all the features you would expect in a Minecraft server, with additional performance gain
  including async, cloud computing compatibility, on demand
  loading.
  
  Minecraftly can run on traditional Minecraft server setup, with local file system. The advantage is, it's able to run on one and multiple servers at the same time, sharing the same NFS, Redis, and MySQL servers as a way of communicating between servers.
  
  We currently support the latest version of Minecraft. The version is always up to date.
  
#Download
  You can download the already compiled version of Minecraftly at https://ci.m.ly
  
#How it works
  As an alternative of Mojang's Minecraft Realms, if you install Minecraftly in your server, then each of your player will have his/her own server, accessible via (player's MC username).(your domain name).com
