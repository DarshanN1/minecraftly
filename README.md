WHAT IS MINECRAFTLY?

  Minecraftly (or Minecraftly Cloud Platform) is an alternative of the official Mojang's Minecraft Realms, designed and written from scratch by Viet Nguyen and Keir Nellyer, with assistance from some friendly developers and helpers from the internet. It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance.

  It has all the features you would expect in a Minecraft server, with additional performance gain
  including async, cloud computing compatibility, on demand
  loading.

  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
  accompanying COPYING file for more details.
