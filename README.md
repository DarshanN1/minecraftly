These are the important information for Minecraftly Cloud Platform.  Read them carefully,
as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to install the
software, and what to do if something goes wrong. 

WHAT IS MINECRAFTLY?
  Minecraftly (or Minecraftly Cloud Platform) is a clone and alternative of the official Mojang's Minecraft Realms, designed written from scratch by Viet Nguyen & Keir Nellyer, with assistance from some friendly developers and helpers from the internet. It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance.

  It has all the features you would expect in a Minecraft server, with additional performance gain
  including async, cloud computing compatibility, on demand
  loading.

  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
  accompanying COPYING file for more details.
